### Sitios Permanentes de Calibraci√≥n y Monitoreo de la Biodiversidad

SiPeCam is a National Monitoring System of Biodiversity and Permanent Sites for Calibration that collects
a great amount of visual and sound data in order to make it available for the people interested to train neural network 
models. 

Visual data allows us to identify the class, family, genera or species. In addition, sound data is being developed with 
external specialists that records bat calls directly in the field.

All available data can be used as reference to inform over the species presence in other period of time of the same site; 
hence, it is useful for monitoring biodiversity.

## Accessing SiPeCaM data
SiPeCaM project data is available to the community free of charge.

The Amazon bucket contains a subset of the complete data set from the project and can be found in:
`s3://sipecam-open-data` in the us-east-1 AWS region.

## Other Sources

SiPeCaM has developed a map that might be useful for the researchers; you can find it

A spanish [presentation](https://monitoreo.conabio.gob.mx/sipecam_files/SiPeCaM_Total.pdf) has been made to give more 
context about the project background.
